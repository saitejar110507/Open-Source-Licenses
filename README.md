## 🔍 Other Licenses
While these are the most commonly used open-source licenses, others exist, such as the Zlib License, Open Software License, and Artistic License. If none of the above fit your needs, researching more specific licenses might be beneficial.

🔹 Choosing the right license is crucial—think about whether you want to enforce openness (GPL), give maximum freedom (MIT), or protect against patent risks (Apache 2.0). 

Hope this helps in making an informed decision! 🚀
