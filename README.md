⚠️ **Requirements:** If software is used over a network (e.g., web apps), the source code must be made available to users.  
🔹 **Best For:** Open-source web applications that must remain free.

### **GNU General Public License (GPL) v2.0**
✅ **Allows:** Similar to GPL v3.0 but lacks certain patent protections.  
🔹 **Best For:** Older open-source projects like Linux.

### **GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) v2.1**
✅ **Allows:** Free use, modification, and distribution.  
⚖️ **Requirements:** Modified parts must be open-source, but linking to proprietary software is allowed.  
🔹 **Best For:** Libraries that can work with both open-source and proprietary software.

### **Mozilla Public License (MPL) 2.0**
